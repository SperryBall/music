# The README.md File

### What is this this?
This is a ReadMe file. It's a standard file to have in a GitHub repository. They're basically a small description/tutorial of what the project does. When you create one inside of a repository, GitHub will show it (by default) on the repositry's home page. Typically, it would give a short description about what it does, and a small summary of how to install it and get it running.

### Markdown Language
The .md file extension represents the MarkDown syntax. It's really easy. If you're looking at this file and it looks neat and pretty, its because I used MarkDown to style it. If you view the raw version of this file, you'll see what I mean.

Since we both know what this repository does, and not many other people are going to be viewing it, I figured I'd find cool stuff for you to try out or play around with and put it here. Its up to you, you dont have to. I just figured I would put some resources for cool stuff to make it easier.

### Resources
* [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/ "Materialize"): This is a library by Google that makes styling your web page a lot easier. All of those changes that made your /music site blue were done with Materialize. All I did was add the class 'blue' to the back button and the <nav> element.
